PitchPerfect App

PitchPerfect App is a Python application designed to help users develop the ability to recognize musical notes, intervals, chords, and melodies by ear.
The app generates listening exercises, evaluates user responses, and tracks progress over time to support systematic ear-training practice.

Features:

    Single-note identification exercises
    
    Interval recognition exercises
    
    Chord recognition exercises
    
    Melody playback and imitation practice
    
    Adjustable difficulty levels
    
    Progress tracking and session history
    

Example Use Cases:

    Identify which note was played
    
    Recognize whether an interval is major or minor
    
    Determine chord type by sound
    
    Play back a melody and attempt to reproduce it
    
    Practice a daily ear-training routine
    

    
How It Works:

    App generates an audio exercise
    
    Audio is played to the user
    
    User submits their answer
    
    App checks correctness
    
    Feedback and progress are recorded
    


Core modules include:

    Note Generator
    
    Interval Generator
    
    Chord Generator
    
    Audio Playback System
    
    Scoring System
